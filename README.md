# Vulnerability Assessment Lab Simulation
Vulnerability Management - Using Qualys Vulnerability Scanner

## Objective
The objective of this lab simulation was to perform a comprehensive assessment of the security posture of a Windows 10 guest machine hosted on VMware using the Qualys Vulnerability Scanner - Community Edition.

## Activities

### 1. Initial Assessment
- Conducted a Basic Network Vulnerability Scan.
- Introduced intentional vulnerabilities (deprecated apps, disabled firewall, and enabled remote scanning).

### 2. Preliminary Scan Results
- Initial scan without credentials identified less than 20 vulnerabilities, generally not classified as severe.

### 3. In-Depth Analysis with Credential-Based Scan
- Utilized guest OS credentials for a remote-enabled scan.
- Discovered over 500 vulnerabilities, with over 280 high risk.

### 4. Remediation Actions Taken
- Uninstalled deprecated applications (Firefox and VLC).
- Reconfigured system settings (enabled firewall, adjusted configurations).
- Applied updates to the operating system and applications.

### 5. Post-Remediation Assessment
- Conducted a follow-up vulnerability scan to validate remediation efforts.
- Significant reduction in vulnerabilities, especially in the high-risk category.

## Results
The simulation demonstrated the importance of credential-based scanning for accurate vulnerability assessments. Remediation efforts were successful, resulting in a more secure system configuration.

## Lessons Learned
- The critical role of credential-based scanning.
- The impact of seemingly minor configuration changes on overall system security.

## Conclusion
This simulation provided valuable insights into the vulnerability management process and highlights the need for regular assessments and remediation efforts.
